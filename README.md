If you are going to change your code, please do it in a visual studio project. That way we don't have any more syntax issues in our program. To make the github repository a visual studio project follow these steps (only once, see below for after)

1: In visual studio, make a new empty c++ project just like we do in class, however, don't add any .cpp files to the project yet
2: Download the zip of the repository.
3: Extract the zip somewhere oyu will remember.
4: In the solution explorer (where you normally add a blank .cpp file to the project), go to Add, but then click existing item
5: Add in each .cpp and .h file from the repository
6: Edit your code, then copy paste it in the github repository file

Every time you start working on changing your code, you need to update your code. The easiest way to do this is

1: Open your visual studio project that has the old code in it.
2: Download the most recent zip of the github repository.
3: In solution explorer, find the name of your project and right click it (it will be near the top of the solution explorer)
4: On the drop down menu, click "Open Folder in File Explorer"
5: Extract the github repository zip to this location. Overwrite everything.
6: Edit your code, then copy paste it in the github repository file

If you have any questions let me know
